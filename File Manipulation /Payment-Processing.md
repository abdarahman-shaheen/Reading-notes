# Payment Processing

Payment processing is a vital component of modern commerce, enabling businesses to securely handle transactions.
 To navigate the technical intricacies of payment systems, reading technical documentation is essential. It involves understanding APIs, protocols,
 and integration methods to seamlessly incorporate payment processing into software applications.

Credit card processing is a multi-step system where a merchant communicates with a payment gateway to verify and authorize a credit card transaction. This process ensures the availability of funds and the legitimacy of the transaction. In online credit card processing, the steps remain similar, but they occur electronically through the internet, allowing customers to make purchases on websites and apps securely. This process includes encryption, authorization,
 and settlement to complete the transaction, ensuring both convenience and security for online shoppers.
