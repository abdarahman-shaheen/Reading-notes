## Collection
Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects.
Unlike arrays, the group of objects you work with can grow and shrink dynamically as the needs of the application change.
For some collections, you can assign a key to any object that you put into the collection so that you can quickly retrieve the object by using the key.
A collection is a class, so you must declare an instance of the class before you can add elements to that collection.

## Enum 
Enums are a way to represent a set of named constants,
An enumeration type (or enum type) is a value type defined by a set of named constants of the underlying integral numeric type.
To define an enumeration type, use the enum keyword and specify the names of enum members:
The System.Enum type is the abstract base class of all enumeration types.
