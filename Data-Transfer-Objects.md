# Data Transfer Objects
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are a crucial concept in modern software development, particularly when dealing with APIs and distributed systems.
A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a design pattern used to encapsulate and transfer data between various parts of an application. It acts as a container for data, 
shielding the underlying data structures from direct exposure. 

# Advantages of Using DTOs
1. Decoupling Layers: DTOs promote a clear separation of concerns between different layers of an application. 
2. Data Transformation: When dealing with APIs or distributed systems, data often needs to be transformed into different formats to suit various endpoints.
3. Security: DTOs enable exposing a restricted view of sensitive data to specific layers or external consumers, providing an additional layer of security.
4. Performance Optimization: In certain scenarios, DTOs can optimize data retrieval and transmission by minimizing the amount of data transferred between layers.
