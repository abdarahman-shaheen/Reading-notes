# Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern

## Introduction

In modern software development, two essential concepts are Dependency Injection (DI) and the Repository Design Pattern.
These techniques are widely used to enhance code reusability, maintainability, and testability.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that promotes loose coupling between classes and their dependencies. 
Instead of creating objects directly within a class, the dependencies are provided from the outside, hence the term "injection."
This approach allows for more flexible and modular code.

## Repository Design Pattern

The Repository Design Pattern abstracts the data access logic from the rest of the application. It provides a way to interact with data storage (e.g., a database) using a consistent interface,
typically containing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Solid Principle 
In object-oriented software development, creating code that is both maintainable and scalable is crucial for the success of any project.
SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that guide developers in writing clean, flexible, and robust code.

Why SOLID Matters

1. Flexible: The code can be extended and modified without breaking existing functionality, promoting code reuse and reducing the chances of introducing new bugs.

2. Maintainable: Each principle contributes to code that is easy to comprehend and modify. This makes it simpler to fix issues and add new features in the future.

3. Testable: The principles lead to loosely coupled code, which facilitates unit testing and the isolation of components for testing purposes.

4. Scalable: SOLID principles encourage modularity and clean design, making it easier to scale the codebase as the project grows.
