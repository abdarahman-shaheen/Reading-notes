# MVC
ASP.NET MVC is a web development framework created by Microsoft, which follows the MVC architectural pattern. This pattern divides an application into three key components: the model, the view, and the controller.

In ASP.NET MVC, the model represents the application's data and business logic. It determines how data is structured, accessed, and manipulated. The view is responsible for presenting the user interface, displaying data to the user in a visually appealing manner. Finally, the controller handles user input,
interacts with the model to fetch or update data, and determines which view should be shown to the user.

Razor Pages is an alternative web development model provided by ASP.NET Core. It offers a simpler page-based programming model, as opposed to the MVC pattern.

The main distinction between ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages lies in how they organize and handle requests. MVC focuses on separating concerns, strictly assigning responsibilities to models, views, and controllers.

# In an ASP.NET MVC application with EF.
the MVC pattern is used to structure the application, while EF facilitates the interaction between the application and the underlying database. The model component in MVC represents the application's data and business logic, and EF allows developers to define and work with database entities in an object-oriented and convenient manner.
ASP.NET MVC application with EF provides a powerful and structured approach to web development. It combines the benefits of the MVC pattern for separation of concerns with the convenience of EF for working with databases.
