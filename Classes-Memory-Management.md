## Introduction:
In the world of object-oriented programming, understanding fundamental concepts such as classes, constructors, properties, memory management, and garbage collection is essential. 
## Classes:
Classes serve as the building blocks of object-oriented programming. They define the structure and behavior of objects, encapsulating data and methods within a single entity. Classes enable code organization, reusability, and abstraction, allowing programmers to model real-world entities and implement complex systems.
## Constructors:
Constructors are special methods within classes that initialize objects. They are called when an object is created and are responsible for setting initial values to the object's attributes. 
## Stack and Heap:
In memory management, the stack and heap are two essential components. The stack is a region of memory that keeps track of method invocations, local variables, and function call information. It follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) approach. In contrast, the heap is a dynamic memory region where objects are allocated and deallocated. 
## Garbage Collection Fundamentals:
Garbage collection is an automatic memory management process that identifies and reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. In C#, the runtime environment handles garbage collection, relieving developers from manual memory deallocation.
