# React
Conditional Rendering
Conditional rendering in React empowers components to display different output based on specific conditions. By leveraging JavaScript's conditional operators, such as 'if' statements or the ternary operator, components gain the flexibility to dynamically determine what content to render, resulting in a more responsive and adaptive user interface.

# Lists & Keys
Fundamental to React, lists enable the rendering of multiple items by mapping over an array of data and rendering a dedicated component for each item. The incorporation of keys is crucial for React to identify changes within the list, indicating additions, modifications, or removals. Each key serves as a unique identifier for elements, facilitating efficient list management.

# Forms
React simplifies form handling through a controlled component approach. In this paradigm, form elements like input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons are controlled by React's state. This approach grants React complete control over the form's behavior and data, ensuring a seamless and predictable user input experience.

# Lifting State
Lifting state in React involves elevating the state of a component higher up in the component tree, allowing it to be shared among multiple components. This facilitates access to the same state across different components, ensuring that modifications in one component are reflected in others. It promotes a cohesive and synchronized application state.

# Composition vs. Inheritance
React offers two distinct approaches to code reuse: composition and inheritance. Composition involves creating components that utilize others for their functionality, fostering a modular and flexible design. On the other hand, inheritance entails developing specialized components that extend the capabilities of a base component. In React, the prevailing preference is for composition over inheritance, promoting a more maintainable and scalable codebase.
