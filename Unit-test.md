# Unit test
Unit testing is a software testing practice where individual units or components of code are tested in isolation to ensure they function correctly. It involves writing code that exercises specific units of code, such as methods or functions, and verifies their behavior. 
Unit testing does not involve testing code that interacts with external systems like databases or file systems. It focuses on testing individual units of code in isolation.

Unit testing does not necessarily require additional frameworks or tools. While frameworks and tools like test-driven development (TDD)
## Unit Testing Best Practices:
- Arrange,
-  Act
-  Assert 
 (AAA) Structure your tests in a clear "arrange, act, assert" pattern to improve readability and maintainability.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. With TDD, developers follow a cycle of writing a failing test, writing the minimum amount of code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code to improve its design while keeping the tests passing.

## Benefit:
 1- Improved Code Quality
 2- Faster Debugging
 3- Design Improvement
