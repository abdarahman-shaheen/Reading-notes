# Tree 
In computer science, a tree is a hierarchical data structure that resembles a tree in nature.
It consists of nodes connected by edges, and it is widely used in various algorithms and data organization scenarios.

Basic Components:
Node: A node is a fundamental building block of a tree. It represents a single element in the tree and contains the actual data. In our visual representation,
 a node looks like a circle.
Edge: An edge is a connection between two nodes, representing a relationship between the elements they hold. In our visual representation,
 an edge is a line that connects two circles.

Root Node:
The topmost node of the tree is called the root node. In our visual representation, the root node would be the highest circle.

Parent and Child Nodes:
In a tree, nodes are organized in a parent-child relationship. A node that has branches leading to other nodes is called a parent node. The nodes connected to a parent node are its child nodes

Depth and Level:
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root node to that particular node. On the other hand, the level of a node represents its position in the tree hierarchy. The root node is at level 0, its children are at level 1, and so on.

Leaf Nodes:
Nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes. In our visual representation, leaf nodes would be the nodes at the bottom of the tree without any further branches.

Binary Trees:
A binary tree is a specific type of tree where each node can have at most two children: a left child and a right child. Visualize these binary trees with two branches at most for each parent node.
