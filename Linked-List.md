# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element, called a node, contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, meaning that they can grow or shrink at runtime. This makes them well-suited for applications where the size of the data set is not known in advance, or where the data set is frequently updated.

- Singly linked lists: In a singly linked list, each node only contains a reference to the next node in the list. This makes singly linked lists easy to implement, - but it also makes them more difficult to traverse in reverse.
- Doubly linked lists: In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next node and the previous node in the list. This makes doubly linked lists more difficult to implement, but it also makes them easier to traverse in reverse.
- Circular linked lists: In a circular linked list, the last node in the list points back to the first node in the list. This creates a loop in the list, which can be useful for applications where you need to be able to traverse the list in a circular fashion.
- Circular doubly linked lists: A circular doubly linked list is a doubly linked list where the last node in the list points back to the first node in the list. This combines the advantages of both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
