## What is an interface in C#?

An interface in C# is a declaration of a set of methods that a class or struct must implement.
Interfaces are similar to abstract classes, but they have some important differences. First,
interfaces cannot have any fields. Second, all methods in an interface are abstract, meaning that they do not have any implementation code.

## Why use interfaces?

There are several reasons why you might want to use interfaces in your C# code. First, interfaces can be used to achieve multiple inheritance. In C#, a class can only inherit from one base class. However, it can implement multiple interfaces.
This allows you to create classes that have the functionality of multiple different types.

Interfaces are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the design and maintainability of your C# code. By understanding how to use interfaces, you can write code that is more modular, flexible, and reusable.
