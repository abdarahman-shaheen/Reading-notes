# Routing within MVC
In MVC, navigation properties and routing work together to handle browser requests by mapping them to specific controller actions and returning the appropriate response. 
By default, each MVC application includes routing for the default HomeController.

## Routing within Core
Routing in ASP.NET Core is the process of directing incoming requests to the appropriate application logic residing in controllers and methods.

ASP.NET Core allows you to configure routes in two ways:
1. Conventional Routing: This method determines the route based on predefined conventions defined in route templates. 
2. Attribute-based Routing: With attribute-based routing, the route is determined based on attributes applied to the controllers and methods.
