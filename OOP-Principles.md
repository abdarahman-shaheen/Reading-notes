## OOP Principles



- Inheritance
Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This allows us to reuse code and create more complex and sophisticated objects.

- Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the user. This allows us to focus on the essential features of an object without having to worry about how it works.

- Polymorphism 
is the ability of an object to take on different forms. This is achieved through the use of inheritance and overriding.

- finally
Inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and the other principles of OOP are essential for creating well-designed and maintainable software. By understanding these principles, you can write code that is easier to read, understand, and modify.
