# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Data Structures:
A data structure is a way to organize and store data in a computer's memory. 

## common data structures:
1. Arrays: A contiguous block of memory that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.
2. Linked Lists: A collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.
3. Stacks: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure that allows operations at one end only (top).
4. Queues: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure that allows operations at both ends (front and rear).
5. Trees: A hierarchical structure with nodes that have child nodes, typically used for organizing hierarchical data.
6. Graphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships between entities.
7. Hash Tables: An associative array that maps keys to values using a hash function, providing efficient key-value lookup

## Algorithms:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules for solving a specific problem

## finally:
Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code. 

## Recursion 
 Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem

concepts related to recursion:

- Base Case:  The base case is crucial to prevent infinite recursion and provides a stopping condition.

- Recursive Case: It is the part of the function where it calls itself with smaller inputs, moving closer to the base case. 

## Big O notation
 is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the efficiency or complexity of an algorithm,
 It provides a way to analyze the growth rate of an algorithm's time or space requirements as the input size increases.
concepts:
 1. algorithm's time
 2. space complexity.
